## AI-enabled multihazard forecasting, early warning systems, and response

The **Hazard Systems Research Group (HSRG)** conducts research on the development and application
of artificial intelligence methods to understand, forecast, and manage complex hazard systems.
Our work spans multihazard forecasting, early warning systems, and decision support for
emergency response, with the goal of improving resilience to natural and anthropogenic hazards.
