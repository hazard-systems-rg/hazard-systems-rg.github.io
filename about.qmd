## Hazard Systems Research Group

The **Hazard Systems Research Group (HazSys)** conducts research on the modelling and analysis of
**multihazard risk and resilience**, with a particular focus on the use of **artificial intelligence
and data-driven methods** to understand complex hazard systems.

Our research focuses on **AI-enabled multihazard forecasting, early warning systems, and response**,
combining data-driven models with system-level perspectives on risk and resilience.


### Research themes
- Multihazard and cascading risk modelling  
- AI and machine learning for hazard analysis  
- System-level approaches to risk and resilience  
- Decision support for risk reduction and adaptation  

### Leadership
The group is led by **Lorenzo Nava**, AI+ Academic Senior Fellow at King’s College London.
